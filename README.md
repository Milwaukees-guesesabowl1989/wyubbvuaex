Dude, just finished Squad 36 and I’m like… what did I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Seriously, it’s like this rollercoaster that forgot some of its own parts, you know what I mean? 🤣 One minute, you’re all hyped, next it's like, whoa—this took a weird turn. I swear, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   felt like such a commitment after that cliffhanger they pulled last time.

Man, some of the action scenes slapped, though. Like, BAM, straight-up awesome! But then there's all this emo dialogue and I’m sitting there wondering if the writers are okay.
